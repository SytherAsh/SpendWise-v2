# Status

The living checklist for the whole MVP backlog. Check a box the moment a task is fully
done (see `../README.md` Definition of Done discipline — don't check early). This file is
the only place progress is recorded; epic files under `../epics/` are the specification,
not a log.

Work top-to-bottom within the constraints in `../DEPENDENCY-GRAPH.md` — this list is in
epic order, not strict execution order.

## Epic 0 — [Foundation & Project Scaffolding](../epics/epic-00-foundation.md)

- [x] E0-S1-T1 — Spring Boot project skeleton
- [x] E0-S1-T2 — Next.js project skeleton
- [x] E0-S1-T3 — Android project skeleton
- [x] E0-S1-T4 — FastAPI project skeleton
- [x] E0-S1-T5 — Root tooling audit (`.editorconfig` + `.gitignore` audit stand;
      the PR template this task originally created was deleted once the
      workflow moved to solo direct-to-`main` — see the Git workflow change
      note below)
- [x] E0-S2-T1 — Supabase project & migration tool setup
- [x] E0-S2-T2 — Migration: identity & session tables
- [x] E0-S2-T3 — Migration: transactions & categories
- [x] E0-S2-T4 — Migration: budgets, alerts, EMIs
- [x] E0-S2-T5 — Migration: ML, admin, and chatbot tables
- [x] E0-S2-T6 — Row-Level Security policies
- [x] E0-S3-T1 — CI: Spring Boot unit + integration tests (confirmed green
      on real GitHub Actions — see close-out note below)
- [x] E0-S3-T2 — CI: FastAPI pytest (confirmed green on real GitHub Actions)
- [x] E0-S3-T3 — CI: Android unit tests (confirmed green on real GitHub
      Actions — see close-out note below)
- [x] E0-S3-T4 — CI: frontend build/lint (confirmed green on real GitHub Actions)
- [x] E0-S3-T5 — Branch protection (solo direct-to-`main` guardrails)
      (**manual step for the repo owner** — see the "Branch protection" note
      in the close-out below. Revised from the original "mandatory PR"
      framing: this is now a solo project that works directly on `main`, so
      the rule should only prevent force-pushes and branch deletion and must
      **not** require pull requests. Configuring repo settings needs repo-admin
      access this session doesn't have, and per `CLAUDE.md` must not be changed
      without explicit approval regardless — hence it stays unchecked as an
      owner action, not an agent action.)

### Epic 0 close-out (post-merge, real GitHub verification)

Once a GitHub remote became available, the real (not `act`-simulated) CI run
on the direct push of the E0-S1/S2/S3 commits **failed** on exactly the two
jobs that shell out to a checked-in script (`backend`, `android`) — root
cause: `backend/gradlew` and `android/gradlew` were committed as mode
`100644` (non-executable), since they were originally added from Windows,
which doesn't track the Unix executable bit. Fixed in
[PR #1](https://github.com/SytherAsh/SpendWise-v2/pull/1)
(`fix/epic-0-ci-executable-bit`): `git update-index --chmod=+x` on both
files, plus a new root `.gitattributes` to stop a future contributor's
`core.autocrlf` setting from reintroducing a CRLF shebang line (a related
but distinct way the same class of script breaks on Linux). Verified fixed
on a genuine Linux filesystem (WSL2, not the `/mnt/c` Windows-mounted path,
which reports all files as executable regardless of git's real stored mode)
before pushing, and confirmed via the real GitHub Actions run on the PR and
again on the merge commit to `main` — all 4 jobs green both times.

This is the only defect the real-GitHub verification pass turned up; no
other Epic 0 technical debt was found on repository audit.

### Git workflow change (solo, direct-to-`main`)

The project's Git workflow was changed to a **solo, work-directly-on-`main`**
model (no mandatory feature branches or pull requests). `CLAUDE.md`,
`docs/development_guidelines.md`, `docs/deployment.md`, `docs/testing.md`, and
this file's E0-S3-T5 were updated to match. Branches and PRs remain *available*
(optional) but are no longer the default flow; commits go straight to `main`,
CI runs on each push, and the agent still asks before pushing.

Follow-up cleanup once the workflow changed: `.github/pull_request_template.md`
(from E0-S1-T5) was deleted — a PR template has no purpose when PRs aren't part
of the normal flow. The two feature branches used for PR-based merges before
the workflow change (`fix/epic-0-ci-executable-bit`, `docs/epic-0-closeout`)
were deleted, locally and on the remote, once confirmed fully merged into
`main` (`git merge-base --is-ancestor` — zero unique commits on either).

### Branch protection — exact settings (manual, repo owner)

E0-S3-T5's remaining piece is a one-time GitHub setting the owner applies at
**Settings → Branches → Add branch ruleset (or classic rule)** for `main`:

1. **Block force pushes** — enable. Matches "never force-push"; prevents history clobbering.
2. **Restrict deletions** — enable. Prevents `main` being deleted.
3. **Require status checks to pass** — *optional* for a solo dev. If enabled, it
   applies only when changes arrive via PR; with direct-to-`main` pushes it does
   not gate anything, so it's fine to leave off and rely on watching the CI run
   after each push. (Do **not** pair it with "Require a pull request before
   merging" — that would reintroduce the mandatory-PR flow we just removed.)
4. **Do NOT enable "Require a pull request before merging"** — this is the key
   difference from a team setup; leaving it off is what keeps direct pushes to
   `main` working.

With items 1–2 set, Epic 0's intent is fully satisfied for a solo workflow.

### Epic 3 close-out

All 10 tasks implemented against the frozen `docs/api.md` contract (Android's
Epic 2 Sync module was treated as still "continuing in background" per
`DEPENDENCY-GRAPH.md`, not as a dependency to build against — see the E3-S1
commit body for the one place this mattered: the ingest response shape).
Unit tests (26 new, full backend suite green — 55 tests) were written and
run this session.

**Integration tests — verified green (2026-07-02), after fixing two
pre-existing Epic 1 bugs the first real run of `./gradlew integrationTest`
surfaced** (commit `c26175b`, pushed after the epic's own 4 story commits):
1. `RlsSession`'s three setters called `JdbcTemplate.update(...)` on
   `SELECT set_config(...)` — a query, not DML. PostgreSQL's JDBC driver
   rejects `executeUpdate()` against any statement returning a result set,
   so every RLS-scoped repository call across the whole app was broken (25
   of 48 integration tests failed, including pre-existing Epic 1 tests that
   had apparently never been run against real Docker/CI before). Fixed with
   `queryForObject`.
2. `RefreshTokenService.rotate()`'s replay-detection branch wrote
   `revokeAllForUser(...)` and then threw `InvalidRefreshTokenException` to
   reject the replay — but the method is `@Transactional`, and the default
   rollback-on-RuntimeException behavior silently undid the revocation. The
   replay itself was correctly rejected, but every *other* session for that
   user stayed valid, defeating docs/security.md's "replay revokes all
   sessions" invariant. Fixed with `@Transactional(noRollbackFor = ...)`.

Confirmed via `./gradlew integrationTest` against real Docker (48/48 passing)
and on real GitHub Actions (`gh run watch` — all 4 CI jobs green, including
Backend's Integration tests step). Neither bug is Epic-3-specific; both were
pre-existing and only became visible once Epic 3's push was the first to
actually exercise `integrationTest` end-to-end.
