"""Bank-agnostic merchant/recipient name normalization.

Two-tier canonicalization for a `Recipient_Name` column produced by any
bank-specific statement parser:

1. Exact `UPI_ID` grouping (primary) — rows sharing a UPI ID are
   unambiguously the same payee, regardless of how the name was spelled
   on a given transaction.
2. Fuzzy name clustering (fallback) — for rows without a usable UPI ID,
   cluster near-duplicate name spellings with rapidfuzz similarity +
   scipy hierarchical (complete-linkage) clustering.

Ported near-verbatim (ML strategy phase, 2026-07-13) from the offline
labeling pipeline that produced ml/data/spendwise_labeled.xlsx's
Recipient_Canonical column — same thresholds, same guards, so canonical
names computed here match what already shipped in the training data.

    Only covers rows that have a usable (non-null, non-"N/A") UPI_ID.

    Some extracted UPI IDs are truncated payment-gateway/QR session codes
    (e.g. "paytmqr8", "paytm.s1", "bharatpe") rather than a stable
    per-merchant identifier — the same code gets reused across genuinely
    unrelated recipients, sometimes dozens of them. A raw count-majority
    vote doesn't catch this reliably: a single stray row still clears an
    80%-purity bar once the dominant name repeats a handful of times, and
    conversely a genuine 1-vs-1 tie (two rows, same UPI ID, both legitimate
    spelling variants of one payee) has no majority at all and would be
    rejected outright even though it should merge.

    Two checks, verified against real data:

    1. `max_distinct_names` — a real per-payee UPI handle only ever shows a
       handful of spelling variants for one person (observed max: 3 on this
       dataset); a shared gateway code fans out across dozens of unrelated
       payees (observed min: 11, e.g. "paytmqr2" covers 43 distinct names).
       There's a clean gap between those, so a group with more distinct
       names than this is almost certainly a shared code, not a payee
       identifier, and is skipped entirely — its rows fall through to fuzzy
       clustering against the whole dataset instead. This also protects the
       similarity check below: fuzzy-clustering a large, diverse name list
       inevitably produces a few coincidental matches above any reasonable
       threshold just by how many pairs there are to compare.
    2. `min_name_similarity` — for the (now capped, small) remaining
       groups, legitimate shared-UPI rows are near-duplicate spellings of
       the same name (fuzzy score >= ~60 in every case observed, since the
       UPI handle itself is usually name-derived, e.g. "shloksm2" for
       "SHLOK SA"), while a coincidental collision is an unrelated name
       (fuzzy score <= ~50 in every case observed, e.g. "BIKANER" vs
       "SUNIL SH" both under "paytmqr67"). Each group is fuzzy-clustered
       internally (same complete-linkage clustering as the fallback tier
       below, just scoped to this one group) rather than majority-voted, so
       a tied group still merges correctly when the names are genuinely
       similar, and still splits correctly when they aren't.

    ONE maximal name in the component; otherwise it's ambiguous and is left as

      happens to have the longer string.
    - A component can contain one genuine outlier that shares a short prefix but
      isn't actually a truncation of the "main" chain (e.g. "SAMEER SAWANT" omits
      the middle name "Baliram" entirely, so it doesn't chain with "SAMEER
      BALIRAM SAWA" even though both reduce from "SAMEER" and are the same real
